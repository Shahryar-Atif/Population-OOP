//In a population, the birth rate and death rate are calculated as follows:
//Birth Rate = Number of Births รท Population
//Death Rate = Number of Deaths รท Population
//For example, in a population of 100,000 that has 8,000 births and 6,000 deaths per
//year, the birth rate and death rate are:
//Birth Rate = 8,000 รท 100,000 = 0.08
//Death Rate = 6,000 รท 100,000 = 0.06
//Design a Population class that stores a population, number of births, and number of
//deaths for a period of time. Member functions should return the birth rate and death
//rate. Implement the class in a program.
//Input Validation: Do not accept population figures less than 1, or birth or death numbers lass than 0
